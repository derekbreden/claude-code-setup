description: Interject into another of my live Claude Code sessions — queue a message that lands on that session's next tool call. The write half of /relay.

Send a message INTO another of the user's live Claude Code sessions. Unlike `/relay` (which pulls a session's transcript in here, read-only), this writes: it queues a message that the target session's delivery hook injects on its **next tool call**. Delivery is poll-on-action, not push — a working agent gets it within a tool call or two; a fully idle one waits until it next acts.

Request: **$ARGUMENTS**

Steps:

1. **Resolve the target.** Run:
   `python3 ~/Developer/claude-code-setup/jsonl2md/jsonl2md.py list-sessions`
   Match the target from $ARGUMENTS to exactly one title. If ambiguous or absent, show the candidates and ask — never guess. It must not be this current session. (Add `--cwd <path>` if it lives in another project.)

2. **Confirm the message.** From $ARGUMENTS, separate the target from the message text. If the user hasn't given explicit text — e.g. they asked you to "tell them to reconsider" after reviewing that session via `/relay` — draft the message, show it, and confirm before sending. Keep it to what the receiving agent needs: it sees only this text, not our conversation.

3. **Send it.** Run:
   `python3 ~/Developer/claude-code-setup/jsonl2md/jsonl2md.py send "<matched title>" "<message>"`
   Default mode is **interrupt** — it blocks the target's next tool call and puts the message in front of it. Add `--mode nudge` to attach the message without blocking (gentler, but the agent may sail past it). Add `--from "<label>"` to tag who's speaking.

4. **Report** the queued path it prints and that delivery happens on the target's next tool call. This never reads or disturbs the target's transcript — it only drops a message in its mailbox.

## Reaching for this yourself

This command is model-invocable: when the user has pointed you at another session — "coordinate with X", "that's the other agent working on this" — sending is yours to do, not something to hand back. You do not need the slash command to do it; step 3's `send` is a plain Bash call and the same rules apply either way.

Three rules, because this WRITES into a context that is not yours:

- **Only when the user has opened the door.** Naming another session, or asking you to keep goals coordinated, is that door. Absent it, tell the user what you would say and let them decide.
- **Never send in reply to a message that arrived by relay.** Two agents that can both send will ping-pong, and every message costs the receiver an interrupted tool call. A relayed message is something to report to the user, not something to answer.
- **Send what the receiver needs to act, not what you did.** It sees this text and nothing else — no shared history, no thread. Lead with the fact that changes its behavior. If the message would only be interesting, it is not worth an interrupt: use `--mode nudge` or skip it.
