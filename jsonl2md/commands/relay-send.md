Send a message INTO another of the user's live Claude Code sessions. Unlike `/relay` (which pulls a session's transcript in here, read-only), this writes: it queues a message that the target session's delivery hook injects on its **next tool call**. Delivery is poll-on-action, not push — a working agent gets it within a tool call or two; a fully idle one waits until it next acts.

Request: **$ARGUMENTS**

Steps:

1. **Resolve the target.** Run:
   `python3 ~/Developer/claude-code-setup/jsonl2md/jsonl2md.py list-sessions`
   Match the target from $ARGUMENTS to exactly one title. If ambiguous or absent, show the candidates and ask — never guess. It must not be this current session. (Add `--cwd <path>` if it lives in another project.)

2. **Confirm the message.** From $ARGUMENTS, separate the target from the message text. If the user hasn't given explicit text — e.g. they asked you to "tell them to reconsider" after reviewing that session via `/relay` — draft the message, show it, and confirm before sending. Keep it to what the receiving agent needs: it sees only this text, not our conversation.

3. **Send it.** Run:
   `python3 ~/Developer/claude-code-setup/jsonl2md/jsonl2md.py send "<matched title>" "<message>"`
   Default mode is **interrupt** — it blocks the target's next tool call and puts the message in front of it. Add `--mode nudge` to attach the message without blocking (gentler, but the agent may sail past it). Add `--from "<label>"` to tag who's speaking.

4. **Report** the queued path it prints and that delivery happens on the target's next tool call. This never reads or disturbs the target's transcript — it only drops a message in its mailbox.
