# fragment shown in isolation reads like a real time and biases the classifier

The regex is deliberately lenient and frequently misfires on things that are not durations at all — part numbers ("DIP-28"), filenames ("mini.tsx"), version numbers, quantities, dimensions ("2.54mm"). Decide which of THREE cases applies.

- effort = the text estimates how long someone (especially the assistant itself) will spend doing work. Examples: "this will take a few hours", "half a day of work", "weeks not months", "~4 hours", "maybe a half-day of careful work", "multi-year project".
- projection = the text describes outcomes, properties, regulatory cadences, or durations of states (NOT work effort). Examples: "guaranteed multi-year loss", "bottle goes flat overnight", "tank lasts months", "for as long as the service operates", "every 5 years on 3AL aluminum", "happily for a year".
- none = there is no actual time estimate in the snippet; the regex misfired on text that is not a duration at all.'

# real flagged windows: the bare "read it in context" phrasing was net-negative

# winner — it keeps the real effort catches and fixes projection misfires the
